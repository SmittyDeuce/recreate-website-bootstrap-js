## Part 2: JavaScript Functions  

### **Goal**  
Write JavaScript functions in a separate `.js` file to **simulate interactive features** you might add to your site in the future.  
Focus on using **variables, functions, arrays, and strings**. Your functions do not need to be connected to the website at this stage.  

### **Requirements**  

- Write **4-5 JavaScript functions**.  
- Each function should simulate a **real feature** relevant to your website.  
- Submit the **JavaScript file separately**.  
- Your JavaScript functions should align with the website you created.  
- **Comment your code** to explain what each function does.  


## Features

- **About Page**: Includes a brief bio, a list of my skills, and a carousel featuring my favorite video clips.
- **Contact Page**: Provides links to my **GitHub, LinkedIn, and email**.
- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: A Bootstrap-powered navigation menu for seamless page transitions.

## Use of Bootstrap Components

Bootstrap is used to enhance the styling and responsiveness of the website:

- **Navbar**: A collapsible, dark-themed Bootstrap navbar is used for navigation across pages.
- **Table**: A Bootstrap-styled table displays my skills and years of proficiency in each.
- **Carousel**: A Bootstrap carousel is implemented to showcase my favorite video clips.
- **Grid & Flexbox**: Bootstrap's grid system is used for layout structuring, while `d-flex` helps organize contact icons neatly.
